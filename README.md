## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start

Run the following command:

```sh
# Option 1: Create a new project folder
npx antigravity-ide my-agent-project

# Option 2: Install in the current directory (Smart Install)
npx antigravity-ide
```

Follow the interactive setup:
1.  **Agent Engine**: Choose **Standard (Node.js)** for lightweight tasks or **Advanced (Python)** for AI/Data Science.
2.  **Industry Domain**: Select your field (Finance, Education, etc.) to optimize the Agent's focus and skills.

```sh
npx antigravity-ide my-project --skip-prompts
```

### Update to Latest Version

Keep your Antigravity IDE up to date with the latest skills and brain features:

```sh
npx antigravity-ide update

## 🤖 AI Model Compatibility

**Google Antigravity** is designed to be the "Brain" for any AI model.

- **Google Gemini**: Fully compatible with 2M context window.
- **Anthropic Claude**: Optimized reasoning with `.agent` rules.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Standardized skill formats.

👉 **See [GEMINI.md](./GEMINI.md) for integration guides.**

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🧠 **The Agent Brain (.agent)**
The heart of the system is the `.agent` folder, which contains:
- **Professional Skills**: Production-ready capabilities for Development, DevOps, Security, and Data interactions.
- **Universal Compatibility**: Optimized for **Gemini Pro**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, and **GPT-4o**.
- **Operational Rules**: Pre-defined protocols for safe and effective agent behavior.

### ⚡ **Project Scaffolding (CLI)**
A smart CLI tool to bootstrap new projects:
- **Smart Install**: Detects context to install in current directory or create a new one.
- **Agent Engines**: **Standard** (Node.js, lightweight) or **Advanced** (Python, full-power).
- **Industry Intelligence**: Installs all professional skills but prioritizes your specific domain (Finance, Logistics, etc.) in the Agent's configuration.
- **Fast**: Minimal footprint, intelligent filtering.
